  Task:

  The idea of `smoothing` a function is an important concept in signal processing.
  If `f` is a function and `dx` is some small number, then the smoothed version of `f`
  is the function whose value at a point `x` is the average of `f(x âˆ’ dx)`, `f(x)`, and
  `f(x+dx)`. Write a procedure `smooth` that takes as input a procedure that computes
  `f` and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed `f`. It is sometimes
  valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed
  function, and so on) to obtain the `n-fold smoothed function`. Show how to
  generate the `n`-fold smoothed function of any given function using `smooth` and
  `repeated` from Exercise 1.43.
